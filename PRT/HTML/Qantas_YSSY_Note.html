                        <p>Refer JTC 10-4B/J for additional restrictions during shoulder periods.</p>
                        <p>Aircraft scheduled to arrive in the morning, prior to 0600 LT &ndash; may land before 0600 LT but not before 0500 LT. Failure to comply with the Curfew Regulations will render the Company liable to severe penalties. Compliance with the Curfew Regulations is the Captain&rsquo;s responsibility and the issue of a Takeoff or Landing Clearance does not override any regulation. The airport may not be nominated or used as an Alternate during the curfew.</p>
                        <p><u>Note:</u> &numsp;<em>ATC do not police the curfew and will only advise that the curfew exists and for aircraft to advise intentions. Providing that a taxi clearance is received prior to 2300 LT, aircraft may depart from Rwy 16R after 2300 LT. For departures from Rwy 34L, aircraft are required to be airborne no later than 2245 LT.</em></p>
                        <h3>1.254.4 &numsp;Arrivals</h3>
                        <p>Ferry flights must advise Sydney Approach on first contact of their intended parking area,</p>
                        <p>e.g: Domestic, International or Maintenance.</p>
                        <p>For a turning Missed Approach, e.g. ILS DME Rwy 16L, the turn should not be commenced until reaching the published Missed Approach Point unless instructed by ATC. The use of the term &lsquo;Mandatory&rsquo; with the turning altitude does not override this requirement.</p>
                        <p>Sydney Tower will provide the following additional information prior to issuing a landing clearance:</p>
                        <ul>

         <h4>PRM Approaches</h4>
         <p>Refer to JTC Sydney 11-0 Dual VHF Requirements. The requirement to &ldquo;have the relevant PRM frequency selected prior to transfer to aerodrome control&rdquo; does not infer that there is a requirement to monitor the PRM frequency prior to changing to the Tower frequency. It must, however, be monitored at all times when in contact with the Tower. The Tower will transmit on both frequencies so that in the event of a problem with the Tower&rsquo;s transmission, the PRM frequency can be used to issue any breakout instructions.</p>
         <p>Interception of the localiser will occur at a minimum of 12 nm to touchdown.</p>
         <p>Aircraft will not be cleared to intercept the final approach course until maintaining the final cleared altitude. This requires an early level off at 2000 ft for Rwy 34R and 3000 ft for Rwy 16R. Aircraft will be cleared at 3000 ft or higher for Rwy 34L and 4000 ft or higher for Rwy 16L for dependant approach separation.</p>
         <p>Specific STARS may be assigned when ILS PRM approaches are in use (eg. BOREE &ldquo;P&rdquo; STAR for 16R) to achieve the early level segment required for 16R and 34R. Crew reports highlight the need for careful energy and AFS mode management to simultaneously achieve the altitude constraints, reduce to approach speed and capture the G/S when cleared via these STARs. Note that if cleared to &ldquo;Descend via the STAR&rdquo; and then subsequently &ldquo;Cleared ILS PRM approach&rdquo;, the STAR altitude requirements still apply and early G/S capture should be avoided.</p>
         <h4>Independent Visual Approaches</h4>
         <p>For parallel approaches at Sydney, Flight Crew are encouraged to utilise an appropriate Autopilot Flight Director System (AFDS) mode to ensure that the aircraft intercepts and tracks the final approach path of the nominated runway. Flight Crew should only cross the extended centreline of the nominated runway under specific instruction of the ATC controller.</p>
         <h3>1.254.5 &numsp;Noise Abatement</h3>
         <p>Use Rwy 16L/34R when advised by ATC and when operationally acceptable.</p>
         <p>Aircraft scheduled to arrive prior to 0600 LT must use Rwys 34L/R due to noise abatement reasons. A CAV has been issued to allow aircraft to hold until 0600 LT for those occasions when Rwys 34L/R is unable to be used. See Sydney Early Arrivals &ndash; CAV 01/98 on 4.1.3.</p>

         <p>Airport appears in aircraft AMM database.</p>
         <p>International Terminal Operations: Careful consideration of jet blast affecting standoff bays 11 and 12 should be made when turning onto International terminal bays from apron taxiways Intl 1 and 2.</p>
         <p>For flights departing the domestic and international terminals, the bay number must be advised when reading back the PDC or requesting airways clearance.</p>
         <p>International Eastern Apron: Avoid stopping while exiting via Twy INTL-3 to safeguard personnel and equipment at Bays 31 and 33.</p>
         <p>Ferry and maintenance flights, to and from the hangar area, will arrive at or depart from Bays 84 or 85. Tow to or from these positions will be arranged as needed.</p>
         <p>Interference has been reported at times when parked on bays 8, 32, 34 and 54. The interference normally ceases when the bridge has been withdrawn, or the aircraft pushes back.</p>
         <p>Parking at Gate 31, 33 and 35 is susceptible to overshooting.</p>

         <p>Bay 7A: When approaching from the west, the lead-in line for Bay 7A is 21 m beyond the lead-in line to Bay 6. Extreme caution should be exercised when entering the bay, as the aircraft must turn through approximately 135 degrees and park so as to face southwest. If hand marshalling is required, the marshaller will stand next to the one way sign on the left of the lead-in line.</p>
         <h3>1.254.7 &numsp;Departures</h3>
         <p>For International departures, ATC may not always approve a request for a Twy G intersection departure due to the aircraft potentially blocking other traffic on Twy A.</p>
         <p>Heavy weight departures may not meet the specified SID climb gradient for departures on Rwy 34L.</p>
         <p>Use OPT Takeoff &ndash; All Engines module to determine aircraft gradient capability required to meet SID requirement or advise ATC to request an alternate SID.</p>
         <p>Domestic Taxi Routes</p>
